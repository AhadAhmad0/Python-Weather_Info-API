# Python-Weather_Info-API

This is a simple yet powerful Python-based weather information project that fetches and speaks the current temperature of a city using an API. It’s a great example of combining API usage with text-to-speech capabilities in Python.

🔧 Features:
1.Takes user input for a city name

2.Uses an API to fetch real-time weather data

3.Extracts and displays the current temperature

4.Speaks the temperature aloud using text-to-speech

🧰 Libraries Used:
1.requests: To send HTTP requests to the weather API and fetch data.

2.json: To parse the JSON data returned by the API.

3.pyttsx3: A text-to-speech conversion library in Python that works offline and is platform-independent.

🌐 API Used
This project uses the WeatherAPI.com (or any other weather API of your choice). Make sure to sign up and get a free API key to access weather data.
I have used my API key for the programa and you make sure to create your own API key and use in the program.
